# Final  
Students will also be working on a longer final project that will culminate in a final demonstration. Students will receive guidance on the selection of a final project, but will mostly have creative free reign to develop and evaluate a mobile sensing application. The difficulty of the final project should be on par with about two lab assignments. You will be graded based on (1) the clarity of explanations of technical aspects of the application and (2) the criteria met by your original proposed specifications. 

Create an iOS application that uses the techniques for programming we learned in class. The final project should incorporate at least one technique from three of the six labs assignments. The difficulty of the final project should be at least that of two lab assignments. Ideally, your final project will build upon lab six.
